# Instant Pot Pad See Ew (base from [instant pot chef](https://instantpotchef.ca/instant-pot-pad-see-ew/))

### Preparation: 10 minutes at most
### Cooking time: 35 minutes (24 of those are the whole pressure cooking)
### Serves: 4 (and then some).

## Ingredients
- 2-3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 chicken breasts, cut into small pieces (or one bag of chicken thighs from Costco)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 eggs, whisked in a bowl
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 5 tbsp oyster sauce
- 2 tsp white vinegar
- 2 tsp sugar
- 3 cups water
- 1 Broccoli
- 12 oz. package of wide rice noodles
- Half a leek

## Instructions
1. Prepare the eggs
2. Prepare the sauce in a small bowl: whisk together soy sauce, oyster sauce, vinegar and sugar.
3. Cut the white of the leek and the leaves of the leek in separate boards (or keep them separate).
4. Set your Instant Pot to the saute setting and add vegetable oil.
5. Add chicken breast and garlic and leek white parts and stir for about 2-3 minutes, ensuring that all sides of the chicken pieces are cooked on the surface.
6. Pour your whisked eggs into the Instant Pot and stir some more, until eggs are fully cooked. If any eggs are stuck on the bottom, be sure to scrape it off the bottom with a wooden spoon.
7. Add the sauce from step 2 to your Instant Pot. 
8. Pour in water and Chinese broccoli and stir. 
7. Place rice noodles into the Instant Pot and set on manual pressure cook for 2 minutes. 
8. Once the time is up, do a quick pressure release and remove lid. (from step 7 to the end of step 8 is ~ 25 minutes)
9. Give all the ingredients a good mix, serve on individual plates and enjoy.

## Notes
I added leeks because I couldn't find Chinese broccoli. If you find that, then use those leaves.
Also, if you feel that the sauce is not looking too noticeable, ad a tablespoon of oyster sauce, a tbsp of soy sauce and a tbsp of sugar to the mix.
